# Hello World!

Welcome to my personal website! This may appear to be a generic static landing page, but look a bit further and you'll find a navigatable and dynamic file system fully within the browser, encompassing all of my public Git repositories stored on [Github](https://github.com/edgorman). 

__Pretty neat right ;)__

Feel free to explore the website to see what you can find, and perhaps along the way learn about Linux based systems as I did whilst creating this website. For those who prefer a terminal inteface, click the terminal icon in the navbar for a *(not so surprising)* surpise.

### How This Works

This website has a *Linux inspired* folder structure that and allows a user to navigate the file system using a GUI or terminal interface. All the functions required to perform these commands can be found in the ```/bin/``` directory. 

The Github repositories are cloned and updated automatically on each successful pull request using Github actions. Another shell scripts generates a ```JSON``` file containing the folder structure of the website, which can be found in the ```/etc/``` directory.

There is a ```/home/``` directory that contains my personal blog, and the ```/srv/www/``` directory which is where we are now! This is where my public repositories live, so feel free to go to this file's parent folder and view my other projects.

The terminal interface makes use of a library called [Jquery Terminal](https://terminal.jcubic.pl/), which manages the terminal display and input/output with the user. Originally this website was just a stand-alone terminal, but the design wasn't user friendly enough for non-technical visitors.

The *traditional* side of the website is built upon the [Bootstrap Framework](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [JQuery Library](https://jquery.com/). The repository also makes use of the [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/) to deploy a local http server for testing and development on your local system.

### Background

I'm a Computer Scientist from the [University of Southampton](https://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/) who graduated in 2020 with First Class Honours. My dissertation involved investigating whether machine learning models could be used to detect malicious websites based on their URL, server data and webpage content.

My first experience as a Software Developer was in 2014 as Full-Stack Web Systems Manager for [NoteTones Music Productions](https://web.archive.org/web/20170710041203/http://notetones.com/) *(now dissolved)*. This involved the complete development of the public facing website and client dashboard and communications.

The first internship I had was in 2016 with the company [Wolfram Research](https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/company/0269405D:LN) (thankfully just one town over!) where I was responsible for debugging and repairing the Maths and Physics modules learning modules written in Mathematica and C.

I had another internship during my degree in 2019 at [Roke Manor Research](https://www.roke.co.uk/) designing analytical software capable of understanding and summarising text conversations using statistical analysis, neural networks, and natural language processing techniques.

After completing my degree, I was offered a position at [Roke Manor Research](https://www.roke.co.uk) as a Data Scientist / Machine Learning engineer where I have had first-hand experience in projects across the Defence and National Security domains.

### My Interests

I'm a big fan of space exploration and the latest range of commerical rocket companies like SpaceX, Rocket Lab, and Astra. Reusable rockets are impressive and inpsiring feats, and I believe they're key to humanity's future among the stars.

One hobby I picked up during the first coronavirus lockdown in 2020 was sourdough. Since then I have maintained my own sourdough starter (lovingly named *Dough-lin*) and make my own bread on a weekly basis, as well as the occasional pizza or cookies.

If the scale of this website was evidence enough, I also enjoy programming in my spare time. This includes deploying a game on the Android app store, creating a 3D rendering engine from scratch, and coding competitions including as Advent of Code.
