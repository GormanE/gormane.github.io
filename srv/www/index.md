# Hello World!

Welcome to my personal website! This may appear to be a generic static landing page, but look a bit further and you'll find a navigatable and dynamic file system fully within the browser, encompassing all of my public Git repositories stored on [Github](https://github.com/edgorman).

__Pretty neat right ;)__

Feel free to explore the website to see what you can find, and perhaps along the way learn about Linux based systems as I did whilst creating this website. For those who prefer a terminal inteface, click the terminal icon in the navbar for a *(not so surprising)* surpise.
