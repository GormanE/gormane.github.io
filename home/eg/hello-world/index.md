# Hello World

Welcome to my first blog post! 

I'll keep this introduction brief as I'm sure I'll rant on about my background and interests later on this page, so if you're looking for the __tl;dr__ here it is:

> I'm a Computer Science graduate from the University of Southampton who's interested in all things coding, rocket science and baking bread. I develop small software projects in my spare time and like to play around with machine learning where I can. 

Now the elevator pitch is out of the way, feel free to read on about my background and interests. If you're interested in how I made this website, I recommend you [check out this link](/home/eg/how-its-made).

### Background

I'm a Computer Scientist from the [University of Southampton](https://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/) who graduated in 2020 with First Class Honours. I took optional modules in computer vision, cyber security and machine learning. My dissertation investigated how machine learning models could be used to detect malicious websites based on their URL, host data and webpage content. I was able to produce random forest model with a recall score of 0.995 on webpage content derived features, but concluded a combination of all three sources of features would be the optimal approach. You can find a link to my investigation [here](/srv/www/URL-Analyser).

My first job was in 2014 as a Full-Stack Web Systems Manager for [NoteTones Music Productions](https://web.archive.org/web/20170710041203/http://notetones.com/) *(now dissolved)*. I was initially tasked with refactoring and updating the front and backend system written in ```HTML```, ```PHP```, and ```MySQL```, and quickly moved onto developing a fully-integrated client dashboard system for customers to interact with our staff alongside a live chat functionality made from scratch. Looking back I recognise the *many* mistakes a naive 15 year had made, which I would later learn to exploit and rectify within my cybersecurity module during university.

The first internship I had was in 2016 with the company [Wolfram Research](https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/company/0269405D:LN) (not quite Wolfram Alpha!) where I was responsible for debugging and fixing the Maths and Physics learning modules in their educational software, written in ```Mathematica``` and ```C```. This was quite the steep learning curve for me having to learn a new language, versioning control, testing methodology and quite possibly the hardest of all... __how to use an Apple Mac.__ I thoroughly enjoyed working alongside the core development team and learned so much in the span of six weeks

My second internship was during my second year of university in 2019 at [Roke Manor Research](https://www.roke.co.uk/) in Romsey, Southampton. My group decided to investigate the current state of text analysis techniques in ```Python``` and host these on an internal website complete with corpus ingestion. The techniques we investigated included topic analysis using [TFIDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf), sentiment analysis using [DeepMoji](https://deepmoji.mit.edu/), and text summarising using [LSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_analysis). This project was presented in front of the company and the senior leadership team at the end of the internship, and this performance led to an offer of employment for when I finished my degree.

After completing my degree in 2020 I joined as a Graduate Engineer at [Roke Manor Research](https://www.roke.co.uk) in the Data Science / Machine Learning profession. Since then I have been involved in several projects across the Defence and National Security industry's working in agile development teams. My innovative visualisation work for one client earned an instant award within the company to recognise my contributions. I have also volunteered for educational programs through the company including the summer placement students and Girls in Engineering day.

### My Interests

I'm a big fan of space exploration and the latest range of commerical rocket companies like SpaceX, Rocket Lab, and Astra. Reusable rockets are impressive and inspiring feats, and I believe they're key to humanity's future among the stars.

One hobby I picked up during the first coronavirus lockdown in 2020 was sourdough. Since then I have maintained my own sourdough starter (lovingly named *Dough-lin*) and make my own bread on a weekly basis, as well as the occasional pizza and cookie.

If the scale of this website wasn't evidence enough, I also enjoy programming in my spare time. I have successfully deployed a game on the Android app store, created a 3D rendering engine from scratch in Java, and competed in coding competitions including Advent of Code.
