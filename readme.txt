My name is [[b;;]Edward Gorman] and I'm a 2020 graduate in Computer Science from the University of Southampton.
This website is meant to keep track of my development and thoughts as I begin my professional career.
This page emulates a CLI style interface and comes with several commands for accessing content (to see more, type "help").

It was implemented using the following libraries:
  - [[b;;]jQuery (3.3.1)]            (https://jquery.com/)
  - [[b;;]jQuery Terminal Emulator]  (https://terminal.jcubic.pl/)

If you have any feedback or suggestions then either email me using [[b;;]message-me.exe], or raise it on the Github repo.
