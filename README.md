# Welcome

This site acts like a filesystem, allowing you to traverse every directory and display every file that goes into rendering this and every other page you see. The folders are modelled after a Linux style system, and so in the [root](/) folder you'll find some of the following:

* [/home](/home): The storage area for user files in this system. This includes the subfolder [/home/eg](/home/eg) which contains my personal blog for projects, ramblings or things that interests me.

* [/srv/www](/srv/www/): In this folder you'll find all of my public repositories from Github (except for this one) including every file they host.

After you've had an explore of those feel free to look further, and even give the terminal version of this website a go by clicking on the terminal button in the user settings in the top right of your screen (not advised for mobile users). 

__If you get stuck at any time just click the user button in the top right and click a shortcut link.__
