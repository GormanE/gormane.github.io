# edgorman.github.io

This repository is for my personal website [https://edgorman.github.io](https://edgorman.github.io) that is hosted using Github Pages. It emulates a CLI by using the [JQuery Terminal Library](https://terminal.jcubic.pl) which provides the terminal styling and framework, on which I have written javascript and bash scripts to automatically import my public repositories and allow users to navigate the file structure.
