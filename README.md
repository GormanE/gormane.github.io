# Hello World

This website is a bit unique in the fact that the entire filesystem that makes up the site is fully navigable, allowing you to see and read all the code that goes into making it. The folders are modelled after a Linux style system, and so in the [root](/) folder you'll find some of the following:

* [/home](/home): The storage area for user files in this system. This includes the subfolder [eg](/home/eg) which contains my personal blog for projects, ramblings or things that interests me.

* [/srv/www](/srv/www/): This is where you are now! In this folder you'll find all of my public repositories from Github, freely accessible in all their *(hopefully)* glory.

After you've had an explore of those feel free to look further, and even give the terminal version of this website a go by clicking on the terminal icon in the top right of your screen (not advised for mobile users). If you get stuck at any time just click the user button in the top right and click a shortcut link.
