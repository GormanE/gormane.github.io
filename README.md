# edgorman.github.io

This is the repository for my personal website hosted on Github pages. The design is meant to replicate a command line interface with several commands enabling the user to traverse directories, print documents and run project web pages.

The following resources were used to create this site:
[JQuery](https://jquery.com/)
[JQuery Terminal](https://terminal.jcubic.pl/)
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
[Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
[Basin](https://usebasin.com/)

## Installation
Use the following command to clone the respository:
```
cd your/repo/directory
git clone https://github.com/edgorman/edgorman.github.io
```

## Usage
Open your favourite internet browser and navigate to the following place:
```
your/repo/directory/edgorman.github.io/index.html
```

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

The project page [jobs](https://github.com/edgorman/edgorman.github.io/projects/1) is where I've listed items to do, and show which are being worked on already.
