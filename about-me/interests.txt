I'm a space enthusiast who enjoys watching rocket launches on livestreams from
across the industry, but in particular those from SpaceX who are known for their
propulsive landings of the first stage and their fast-paced and public development
of space technologies. I believe they will play a pivotal role in the 21st century
towards the commercialisation of space and inter-planetary travel to Mars and
beyond. I hope their innovation creates a paradigm shift such that space travel
becomes normalised, expanding humanities influence across the solar system.

After the covid-19 pandemic that caused the UK to enter lockdown in 2020, I have
become a keen baker of sourdough bread and other baked goods such as crumpets,
pancakes, and pizzas. I cultivated the starter myself on the 14th of April and
named it Dough-lin after a character from the Avatar: Legend of Korra show. While
I'm yet to achieve the perfect loaf, I have perfected a pizza recipe that yields
deep flavour and aesthetic charrings on the crust.
